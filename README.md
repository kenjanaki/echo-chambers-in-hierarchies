_NetLogo project demonstrating the simulation of echo chambers formed by hierarchical networks_

The formation and persistence of echo chambers within social networks pose significant challenges to information dissemination and collective decision-making. Previous research has indicated that echo chambers can form through single interaction of agent. However, the mechanisms through which hierarchical network properties influence echo chamber dynamics remain poorly understood. This project aims to develop an agent-based model to systematically investigate the formation of echo chambers within hierarchical networks, building on existing research to elucidate the processes by which echo chambers emerge, persist, and impact information flow. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for devising strategies to mitigate the negative effects of echo chambers in real-world social systems where hierarchies are present.

### Problem Statement
Investigating the possible formation of echo chambers in deterministic and stochastic hierarchical network structures by extending a previous model - "Fränken, J.P. and Pilditch, T., 2021. Cascades across networks are sufficient for the formation of echo chambers: An agent-based model. Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, 24(3)."

### Proposed Methodology
Extending previous model by implementing deterministic and stochastic networks to it. A different kind of hatch function is to be used.
